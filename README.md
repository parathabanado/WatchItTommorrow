# Watch It Tomorrow üé¨

A Chrome extension designed to help you reclaim your focus and build healthier YouTube viewing habits.

This extension provides a suite of tools to prevent binge-watching and encourage mindful content consumption by giving you more control over when and how you watch videos.



## Features

- üß† Mindful Pause Screen:  
  - Before any video starts, a mandatory pause screen appears with a countdown timer. This gives you a moment to consciously decide if you really want to watch, rather than falling into an autoplay trap. The minimum duration is 27 seconds, but you can increase it in the options.
- üöÄ "Watch it Tomorrow?" Escape Button:  
  - During the pause, a button appears, offering an easy way out. Clicking it instantly saves the video to a special list and redirects you to the YouTube homepage, helping you break the cycle of endless recommendations.
- üìã "Watch Tomorrow" List:  
  - Easily access all the videos you've deferred via the extension's popup. The list is clean, simple, and includes a button to remove videos individually or clear the entire list with a single click.
- üñ±Ô∏è Right-Click to Save:  
  - Save a video without even opening it. Right-click on any video thumbnail and select "Watch Tomorrow" from the context menu to add it directly to your list.
